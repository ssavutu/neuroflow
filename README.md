# NOTE TO NEUROFLOW EMPLOYEES
This project requires a .env file in the root directory of the project(where this README file is) with a Spotify CLIENT_ID field and a CLIENT_SECRET field. The reason the project is set up this way is to avoid exposing my API keys to the internet. 

My apologies for the inconvenience.

Example .env file:
CLIENT_ID="**************************"
CLIENT_SECRET="*************************"
